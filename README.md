    A starter application for using an Offscreen Canvas Worker in a React application

After creating [Orbs](https://github.com/devklick/orbs), I wanted to play around 
with more HTML5 animations. Since I like using React, and using an offscreen 
canvas is almost definitely worthwhile (compared to a standard canvas), I've 
created this starter application which can be used as a template.
